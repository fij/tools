cars

When we arrived in San Francisco in 2011, I needed to buy quickly a car from craigslist. 
Cars that we liked were usually gone within a few hours. I was working, so I couldn't click
all the time. This script emailed me a short note whenever it saw a new ad of a car that 
had parameters within the ranges that we liked. 

This is an example note that I received from the script:
1995 Toyota T 100 - $2000 pic (http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/cto/2508570594.html)

The Perl script writes email_body.txt and reads/writes log.txt.

After starting the script, I contacted 4 or 5 people who were selling their cars, 
and finally I bought a Toyota Corolla 1996. We loved it. It ran 14k miles with us.
